TODO: probably need to provide links later

This project was developed by Youngjin Park, Jonny Pei, and Vivek Verma.

## Setup/Installation

1. Install the latest version of Python. We developed our code and ran experiments using Python 3.9.7, but any slightly older/newer version should work fine.

2. Clone this repo and move into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/vivek3141/cs270-final-project.git
cd cs270-final-project
```

2. Install the required packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the repo.
```
pip install -e .
```
